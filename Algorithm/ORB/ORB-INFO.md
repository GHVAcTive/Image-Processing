## 📝 Overview

This project implements the **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)** algorithm to detect and match key points between two images. It is based on the OpenCV library and demonstrates how to detect and match features using the **ORB** feature detector. ORB is a free alternative to SURF and is not subject to licensing restrictions, making it widely available for use in various applications.

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. **Install Python and Pip:**

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. **Install OpenCV:**

Install OpenCV via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies:**

You will also need `numpy` for array handling. Install it with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 🖼️ Images

- **`RR-SURF-1.png`**: The front view of the car (used as the first image in keypoint detection).
- **`RR-SURF-2.webp`**: The side view of the car (used as the second image to demonstrate keypoint matching).

Make sure these images are placed in the `Images` folder.

---

## ⚙️ Code Explanation

### 1. **Image Loading and Preprocessing:**

The images are loaded using OpenCV's `imread` function in grayscale (`cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`) for efficient processing. The second image (`img2`) is resized to match the dimensions of the first image (`img1`) using the `cv2.resize()` function.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import os

# Get the absolute path to the project root
base_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../'))

# Image paths
img1_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'Images', 'RR-SURF-1.png')
img2_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'Images', 'RR-SURF-2.webp')

# Load images in grayscale
img1 = cv2.imread(img1_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
img2 = cv2.imread(img2_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
```

---

### 2. **ORB Detector:**

- **ORB Initialization**: `cv2.ORB_create(400)` initializes the ORB detector with a maximum of 400 keypoints.
- **Keypoint Detection**: Keypoints and descriptors are computed for both images using `detectAndCompute()`.

```python
# Create ORB detector
orb = cv2.ORB_create(400)

# Detect keypoints and compute descriptors
kp1, des1 = orb.detectAndCompute(img1, None)
kp2, des2 = orb.detectAndCompute(img2_resized, None)
```

---

### 3. **Descriptor Matching:**

- **Brute-Force Matching**: The `cv2.BFMatcher()` matches the descriptors of the two images.
- **Matching**: Matches are sorted in ascending order of distance, and the best matches are selected.

```python
# Create Brute-Force matcher
bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING, crossCheck=True)

# Match descriptors
matches = bf.match(des1, des2)

# Sort matches by distance
matches = sorted(matches, key = lambda x: x.distance)
```

---

### 4. **Displaying Matches:**

- **Draw Matches**: The matches are visualized using `cv2.drawMatches()`, which draws lines between matched keypoints from both images.
- **Save the Result**: The resulting image is saved in the **Results** folder as `orb_result.png`.

```python
# Draw the matches between keypoints in both images
result_img = cv2.drawMatches(img1, kp1, img2_resized, kp2, matches, None, flags=cv2.DrawMatchesFlags_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS)

# Save the result image
cv2.imwrite(output_path, result_img)
```

---

## 🖥️ **How to Run**

1. Place your images in the `Images` folder.
2. Ensure the script is placed in the `ORB` folder.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python orb_match.py
   ```

4. The output result will be saved in the **Results** folder as `orb_result.png`.

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

- **ORB not found error:**  
  If you get an error related to ORB not being found, ensure that you have installed `opencv-python` as described above. ORB is a part of the base OpenCV package and should be available after installation.

---

## 📂 **Folder Structure Recap**

- **Images Folder**: Contains the input images (`RR-SURF-1.png` and `RR-SURF-2.webp`).
- **Results Folder**: Stores the output result (`orb_result.png`).
- **orb_match.py**: The Python script containing the logic for detecting and matching keypoints using ORB.

## 🔄 **Alternative: SURF Implementation**

If you are interested in using the **SURF** (Speeded-Up Robust Features) algorithm instead of ORB, you can refer to the **SURF** README file for an alternative implementation.
