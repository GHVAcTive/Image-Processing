# 🎯 **RANSAC-based Image Stitching Algorithm** 🖼️🔄

This repository demonstrates how to **stitch images** together using **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** to detect keypoints and **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** to estimate a robust homography transformation.

## 📝 **Overview**

This project applies **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** for robust **image stitching**. It begins by detecting **keypoints** using **SIFT** (or other keypoint detectors), matching them across two images, and using **RANSAC** to estimate the homography transformation that aligns the two images while discarding outlier matches.

---

## 🔧 **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **OpenCV**  
  Install it via:

  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
  ```

- **NumPy**  
  Install with:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

---

## 📥 **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Image-Processing
   ```

2. **Set up Images Folder:**

   Place the images you wish to stitch (`Arcade-Left-RANSAC-1.jpg` and `Arcade-Right-RANSAC-1.jpg`) in the `Algorithm/RANSAC/Images` folder.

3. **Run the Script** after setting up the folder:

   ```bash
   python ransac_match.py
   ```

---

## ⚙️ **Usage Instructions**

1. **Navigate to the RANSAC Folder:**

   ```bash
   cd Algorithm/RANSAC
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python ransac_match.py
   ```

   - The script will load the images, detect keypoints, match them, apply RANSAC to estimate the homography, and produce the final stitched image.

## 🧑‍💻 **Code Explanation**

The **`ransac_match.py`** script performs the following steps:

### 1. **Image Loading and Setup**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os

# Define paths to the images
img1_path = 'Images/Arcade-Left-RANSAC-1.jpg'
img2_path = 'Images/Arcade-Right-RANSAC-1.jpg'
output_path = 'Results/stitched_result.png'

# Load the images in grayscale
img1 = cv2.imread(img1_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
img2 = cv2.imread(img2_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
```

- **Image Loading**:  
  The images are loaded in grayscale to simplify the processing and reduce computation.

### 2. **SIFT Keypoint Detection and Matching**

```python
# Create a SIFT detector
sift = cv2.SIFT_create()

# Detect keypoints and descriptors
kp1, des1 = sift.detectAndCompute(img1, None)
kp2, des2 = sift.detectAndCompute(img2, None)

# Brute Force Matcher with KNN and Lowe's Ratio Test
bf = cv2.BFMatcher()
matches = bf.knnMatch(des1, des2, k=2)
good_matches = [m for m, n in matches if m.distance < 0.75 * n.distance]
```

- **SIFT Keypoints and Descriptors**:  
  Keypoints are detected, and their descriptors are computed. Descriptors describe the local image patches around keypoints.
  
- **Brute-Force Matching with Lowe's Ratio Test**:  
  The nearest neighbors of descriptors from both images are found, and Lowe’s ratio test filters out bad matches by comparing the distance between the closest matches.

### 3. **RANSAC for Homography Estimation**

```python
# Extract matching points
pts1 = np.float32([kp1[m.queryIdx].pt for m in good_matches])
pts2 = np.float32([kp2[m.trainIdx].pt for m in good_matches])

# Apply RANSAC to estimate the homography
H, mask = cv2.findHomography(pts1, pts2, cv2.RANSAC, 5.0)
```

- **Extract Points**:  
  The 2D coordinates of the matched keypoints are extracted for both images.
  
- **RANSAC**:  
  RANSAC is applied to find a robust homography transformation that best maps keypoints from the first image to the second while rejecting outliers.

### 4. **Image Warping and Stitching**

```python
# Warp the first image to the second image’s perspective
height, width = img2.shape
result_img = cv2.warpPerspective(img1, H, (width, height))

# Blend the images
final_result = cv2.addWeighted(result_img, 0.5, img2, 0.5, 0)
```

- **Warping**:  
  The first image is warped to align with the second image using the homography matrix computed by RANSAC.
  
- **Blending**:  
  The images are blended together using a weighted average for smoother transitions.

### 5. **Save the Result**

```python
# Save the final result
cv2.imwrite(output_path, final_result)
```

- **Output**:  
  The final stitched image is saved as `stitched_result.png` in the `Results` folder.

## 📖 **Theory Behind RANSAC**

**RANSAC** (Random Sample Consensus) is a robust method used to estimate model parameters from data containing a significant percentage of outliers. In the context of image stitching:

- **Key Idea**:  
  RANSAC helps estimate the **homography matrix** that transforms one image to align with another. It works by selecting random subsets of matched keypoints and fitting a transformation model to them, while outliers (incorrect matches) are excluded from the model.

- **Process**:
  1. **Randomly Sample Points**: Select a small random subset of matching points.
  2. **Estimate Transformation**: Compute the transformation (homography) using these points.
  3. **Evaluate and Count Inliers**: Check how many points in the entire dataset fit the transformation (inliers).
  4. **Repeat**: Iterate this process multiple times and choose the transformation with the highest inlier count.

- **Advantages**:  
  - **Robustness** to outliers.
  - Can handle large amounts of incorrect matches, making it perfect for real-world applications like image stitching.

## 📊 **Output**

The output is a **stitched panorama** stored in the **`Results`** folder:

- **File Name**: `stitched_result.png`
- **Location**: `Results/stitched_result.png`

The panorama will show both input images aligned and blended seamlessly.

---

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

- **Image Path Issues**:  
  Ensure the paths to your images are correct.
  
- **Insufficient Matches**:  
  Check the number of good matches:

  ```python
  print(f"Good matches: {len(good_matches)}")
  ```

- **RANSAC Failure**:  
  If the RANSAC algorithm fails, consider adjusting the parameters or using different images with clearer matching features.
