## 📝 Overview

This project implements the **SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)** algorithm to detect and match key points between two images. It is based on the OpenCV library and demonstrates how to detect and match features using the **SURF** feature detector. SURF is a patented algorithm, and in OpenCV, it's excluded unless specifically enabled. If you're facing issues related to SURF not being available, check the installation notes below or use an alternative like **ORB**.

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. **Install Python and Pip:**

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. **Install OpenCV:**

Install OpenCV with the contrib modules (which include SURF) via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies:**

You will also need `numpy` for array handling. Install it with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## 🖼️ Images

- **`RR-SURF-1.png`**: The front view of the car (used as the first image in keypoint detection).
- **`RR-SURF-2.webp`**: The side view of the car (used as the second image to demonstrate keypoint matching).

Make sure these images are placed in the `Images` folder.

---

## ⚙️ Code Explanation

### 1. **Image Loading and Preprocessing:**

The images are loaded using OpenCV's `imread` function in grayscale (`cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`) for efficient processing. The second image (`img2`) is resized to match the dimensions of the first image (`img1`) using the `cv2.resize()` function.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import os

# Load images in grayscale
img1 = cv2.imread('path_to_image_1', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
img2 = cv2.imread('path_to_image_2', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Resize second image to match the first
img2 = cv2.resize(img2, (img1.shape[1], img1.shape[0]))
```

---

### 2. **SURF Detector:**

- **SURF Initialization**: `cv2.xfeatures2d.SURF_create(400)` initializes the SURF detector with a Hessian threshold of 400. This threshold controls the number of keypoints detected.
- **Keypoint Detection**: Keypoints and descriptors are computed for both images using `detectAndCompute()`.

```python
# Initialize SURF detector with Hessian threshold of 400
surf = cv2.xfeatures2d.SURF_create(400)

# Detect keypoints and compute descriptors
kp1, des1 = surf.detectAndCompute(img1, None)
kp2, des2 = surf.detectAndCompute(img2, None)
```

---

### 3. **Descriptor Matching:**

- **Brute-Force Matching**: The `cv2.BFMatcher()` matches the descriptors of the two images.
- **Lowe's Ratio Test**: This test is applied to filter out bad matches by comparing the first and second closest matches.

```python
# Create a brute-force matcher
bf = cv2.BFMatcher()

# Apply Lowe's ratio test to find good matches
matches = bf.knnMatch(des1, des2, k=2)
good_matches = [m for m, n in matches if m.distance < 0.75 * n.distance]
```

---

### 4. **Displaying Matches:**

- **Draw Matches**: The matches are visualized using `cv2.drawMatches()`, which draws lines between matched keypoints.
- **Save the Result**: The resulting image is saved in the **Results** folder as `surf_result.png`.

```python
# Draw the matches between keypoints in both images
result_img = cv2.drawMatches(img1, kp1, img2, kp2, good_matches, None, flags=cv2.DrawMatchesFlags_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS)

# Save the result image
cv2.imwrite('path_to_output_image', result_img)
```

---

## 🖥️ **How to Run**

1. Place your images in the `Images` folder.
2. Ensure the script is placed in the `SURF` folder.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python surf_match.py
   ```

4. The output result will be saved in the **Results** folder as `surf_result.png`.

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

- **SURF not found error:**  
  If you get an error like `cv2.xfeatures2d.SURF_create not found`, it means your OpenCV installation doesn’t include the contrib module with SURF. To resolve this:
  - Install `opencv-contrib-python` as described above.
  - If the issue persists, you may need to build OpenCV from source with the `OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE` option enabled.

---

## 📂 **Folder Structure Recap**

- **Images Folder**: Contains the input images (`RR-SURF-1.png` and `RR-SURF-2.webp`).
- **Results Folder**: Stores the output result (`surf_result.png`).
- **surf_match.py**: The Python script containing the logic for detecting and matching keypoints using SURF.

## 🔄 **Alternative: ORB Implementation**

If you're facing issues with SURF due to licensing restrictions, you can replace SURF with **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**, a free alternative to SURF. Please refer to the alternative **ORB** README file for details on how to implement it.
