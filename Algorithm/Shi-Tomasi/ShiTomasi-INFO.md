# 🎯 **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection Algorithm** 🖼️✨

This repository demonstrates how to apply the **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection** technique to an image to detect and highlight **strong corners** using **large green circles** for clear visibility. Shi-Tomasi is a refinement of the Harris detector, producing more stable and accurate corner localization. It's widely used in object tracking, motion estimation, and structure-from-motion tasks.

## 📝 **Overview**

The **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection** algorithm is used to find good features to track. This implementation uses OpenCV to:

- Convert an image to grayscale.
- Detect a specified number of strong corners.
- Mark those corners using large green circles for better visibility.
- Save the result in the `Results` directory.

## 📚 **Theory & Background**

### 🔍 What is Corner Detection?

Corner detection is a key operation in image processing and computer vision. It identifies points in an image where the gradient changes in multiple directions — these are typically at the junctions of edges or textured regions.

These corner points are:
- Stable under transformations.
- Useful for tasks like image stitching, tracking, structure-from-motion, SLAM, etc.

---

### 🧠 What is the Shi-Tomasi Algorithm?

The **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector**, also known as **Good Features to Track**, is a refined version of the **Harris Corner Detector**. It was proposed by **Jianbo Shi** and **Carlo Tomasi** in their 1994 paper titled:

> 📖 **Shi, J., & Tomasi, C. (1994). _Good Features to Track_. Proceedings of IEEE CVPR.**

#### 🧪 How it Works:

- It constructs the **auto-correlation matrix** (second moment matrix) from image gradients in a local window.
- Instead of computing a corner measure like Harris, it finds the **minimum eigenvalue** of that matrix.
- If this smallest eigenvalue is greater than a certain **threshold**, the pixel is considered a **good corner**.

#### ✅ Why is it Better?

- It is **simpler**, **faster**, and **more robust** than Harris for tracking corners in successive frames.
- Produces **fewer false positives** and **more stable** corners.

## 🧑‍💻 **Code Explanation**

### 1. **Image Loading**

```python
img_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'Images', 'Technical-Shi_Tomasi.jpg')
img = cv2.imread(img_path)
```

- Loads the input image from the `Images/` folder.

---

### 2. **Convert to Grayscale**

```python
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
```

- Converts the image to grayscale for processing.

---

### 3. **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection**

```python
corners = cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack(gray, maxCorners=100, qualityLevel=0.01, minDistance=10, blockSize=3)
```

- Detects up to 100 strong corners.
- `qualityLevel=0.01`: minimum accepted quality of corners.
- `minDistance=10`: ensures corners are spaced out.

---

### 4. **Draw Large Green Circles**

```python
for corner in corners:
    x, y = corner.ravel()
    cv2.circle(img, (x, y), 20, (0, 255, 0), thickness=5)
```

- Draws **large green circles** (radius 20, thickness 5) around detected corners to ensure **maximum visibility**.

---

### 5. **Display and Save the Output**

```python
output_path = os.path.join(base_path, 'Results', 'shi_tomasi_corners_result.png')
cv2.imwrite(output_path, img)
cv2.imshow('Shi-Tomasi Corners - Enhanced Visibility', img)
```

- Saves the result to the `Results/` folder.
- Displays it in a pop-up window.

---

## 📊 **Output**

🖼️ The final output will display **large and bold green circles** marking the corners on the original image.  
✅ Corners are clearly visible even at small scales.

- **Output Image**: `shi_tomasi_corners_result.png`  
- **Saved in**: `Results/` directory

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

| Issue                            | Solution                                                              |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No output or image not visible   | Ensure the image path is correct and image is in the `Images/` folder |
| Corners not visible              | Try lowering the `qualityLevel` or increasing circle size/radius      |
| Too many or too few corners      | Adjust `maxCorners` and `minDistance` values                          |
| No window displayed              | Ensure you're not using a headless environment (like WSL without GUI) |
