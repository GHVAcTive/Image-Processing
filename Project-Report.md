## 📌 Introduction

In this project, we explore a suite of widely used feature detection and matching algorithms in computer vision. The primary goal is to extract and visualize important points or features from input images. These features are crucial in applications such as object tracking, panorama stitching, motion analysis, and more.

Each algorithm brings its own benefits depending on image scale, rotation, and illumination. This report offers an intuitive understanding, implementation details, and a visual demonstration of each technique.

## 🧪 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 Harris Corner Detection

#### 📖 Theory & Background

Harris Corner Detection is one of the oldest and most reliable methods to identify interest points in an image. It detects points where the gradient of intensity changes significantly in multiple directions.

- Proposed by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988.
- Computes a **corner response function** based on eigenvalues of the structure tensor.
- Sensitive to scale and rotation.

#### 📂 Implementation Details

- Image is converted to grayscale.
- `cv2.cornerHarris()` is used to compute the corner response.
- Dilation and thresholding applied to mark strong corners in **blue**.

### 🔹 Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection

#### 📖 Theory & Background

Shi-Tomasi, or "Good Features to Track", improves Harris by selecting corners based on the **minimum eigenvalue** rather than the sum.

- Proposed by Jianbo Shi and Carlo Tomasi (1994).
- More robust for motion tracking and optical flow.

#### 📂 Implementation Details

- `cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack()` identifies the best `N` corners.
- Large **green circles** used for visibility.
- Adjustable parameters: `maxCorners`, `qualityLevel`, `minDistance`.

### 🔹 SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)

#### 📖 Theory & Background

SIFT is a powerful keypoint detection and descriptor extraction technique.

- Introduced by David Lowe (1999).
- Detects features invariant to **scale**, **rotation**, and **illumination**.
- Builds a scale-space and uses DOG (Difference of Gaussian) for keypoint detection.

#### 📂 Implementation Details

- Uses `cv2.SIFT_create()` to detect and compute descriptors.
- Features are matched using Brute Force Matcher (`BFMatcher`) and drawn using `cv2.drawMatches()`.

#### 🖼 Output

### 🔹 SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)

#### 📖 Theory & Background

SURF is an optimized version of SIFT designed to be faster and more efficient.

- Uses an integral image for quick convolution.
- Uses **Hessian matrix** to detect blobs.

> 🔒 Note: SURF is patented and may require `opencv-contrib-python`.

#### 📂 Implementation Details

- Features are detected using `cv2.xfeatures2d.SURF_create()`.
- Descriptors matched using Brute Force.
- Works well under scale and rotation.

### 🔹 ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

#### 📖 Theory & Background

ORB is an open-source alternative to SIFT and SURF.

- Combines FAST keypoint detector with BRIEF descriptors.
- Rotation and scale invariant.
- Very efficient and suitable for real-time apps.

#### 📂 Implementation Details

- Uses `cv2.ORB_create()` to extract features.
- Binary descriptors matched using `BFMatcher` with Hamming norm.

#### 🖼 Output

---

### 🔹 RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)

#### 📖 Theory & Background

RANSAC is a robust method to estimate a model from noisy data.

- Iteratively selects random sample sets and computes a transformation matrix (e.g. Homography).
- Outliers are rejected to improve match accuracy.

#### 📂 Implementation Details

- Feature points detected using SIFT/ORB.
- Good matches filtered using `cv2.findHomography(..., cv2.RANSAC)`.
- Final result is a warped image or matched keypoints excluding outliers.
